# Minerva
Social Media Style Webpage to Provide Information Regarding Health and Wellness

## What is Minerva
Minerva is a social media style feed used to display and share information, specifically regarding health and wellness. This solution allows further details and information on health hacks to be provided to the user through the use of links to external sources. As well, as social media continues to grow in popularity, a social media style feed is easy to navigate, minimizing the learning time required for users to effectively use Minerva.
Note: The project was named Minerva after the Roman goddess of medicine and wisdom.

## The Prototype
This prototype was coded using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and JavaScript. The prototype was designed to folllow UI best practices and meet basic accessibility requirements such as colour contrast.

## Design Thinking Process Overview
### Background Information
The life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy in Canada have been increasing consistently over the past decade, however, two-thirds of Canadian adults live with at least one MODIFIABLE risk factor for chronic disease, includign self-reported tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviours, unhealthy eating, harmful use of alcohol, and obesity. <br>

### Situation of Concern (ie. Project Focus)
With the high rates of risk factors for chronic disease among Canadian adults, it is necessary to implement individual, community, and population interventions to address these public health challenges. A successful solution would benefit users by providing information regarding the importance of health and wellness as well as simple tips that can start leading them in the correct direction.

### Personas
In order to gain a better understanding of my ideal users, I created a series of 3 personas, each representing a different demographic that my solution aims to target.

#### Persona 1: Nala Riggs
Nala is a young professional beginning a new career for a large company within the technology industry. She is passionate about the environment and her personal health and wellness.

#### Persona 2: Ewan Bender
Ewan is a middle aged professional within the investment industry. He values his family, job security, and employer offered benefits.

#### Persona 3: Bertie Allman
Bertie is a newly retired professional. As an aging adult, his main pain point is the typical decline of health among aging adults as he wishes for an values his continuing health, which allows him to spend time with family.
